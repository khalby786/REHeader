# GitHub Profile README Header Image Generator

*That's a very long name. By the time I finish reading the title, a whole day will be over.*

Generate beautiful header images for your GitHub profile READMEs.

GitHub now allows us to add READMEs to our profile describing ourselves but what if we need a header image in the README with your name and a small greeting? This generator comes to your rescue and saves the day (well, not a big thing and not very useful and it doesn't really save the day :shrug:)

Once you generate the image and upload it somewhere (like a CDN), you can use it in your README like this:

This is literally something I created in 1 day with Vue, so you're sure to find a lot of bugs, make sure to report them [here](https://github.com/khalby786/gh-readme-header-image-gen/issues).

New features are being added whenever I can, make sure to check 'em out.

**NOTE:** The preview that is being shown is actually very wide, but it looks like it has a small width because I did that to prevent the browser from scrolling horizontally. However I have shown the generated image with full width (and thereby allowing the browser to scroll horizontally).
